title: Save 12 vacation days a year with response templates on your phone
---

If you've ever tried typing a long chunk of text on your mobile in response, you'll know how much of a pain it is. Especially if it is a response that you've been typing over and over numerous times, or one that you're trying to copy and paste from elsewhere you've previously replied. 

We set out to understand how long it would take to respond using the methods above (aka the "normal people" approach) vs using a keyboard response template. 

Based on a 30-run trial, it took about 46 - 262 seconds to respond by going out of the app, finding the right response, and copying and pasting it in. On the other hand, it took about 3 - 10 seconds to find the right response template and pop it into the message field using the keyboard approach.

That's 6 - 15 x faster if you're the smart person with that response keyboard. And if you work on your phone a lot, like some of our interviewees do, that's a boatload of time saved for you to do other more productive (or fun) things. 

On average, the sales and operations people we talked to send about 50 responses a day on their mobiles alone. About 70% of their responses can be covered with about 10 templates. That's 35 responses a day that had close to two minutes saved each. In one day, they save 70 minutes. You may go "Meh, that's not much" - but that's probably about or longer than lunchtime. Imagine saving one lunch hour per day!

Take that 70 minutes multiplied by the ~245 days you work per day and that's 285 hours per year, or close to 12 days. 12 days a year = probably 75-90% of total leave most people get in a year. 

Working out the economics of time savings for individuals show us that it could significantly reduce wasted time. But if we think a little more in scale, imagine a company with 5000 sales reps saving that amount of time per year. It's 60,000 man-days or 164 man-years saved in a year. Take that, productivity crunch. 

In the next post, we'll cover the importance of standardizing responses and how that improves the productivity and morale of employees. Stay tuned!
