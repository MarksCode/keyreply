                <h2><a id="start">Getting started</a></h2>

                <h3>How do I get started using KeyReply?</h3>
                <p>You can start by adding responses that you commonly use on the web app (app.keyreply.com) or the iOS application. To send responses, you should use KeyReply keyboard on iOS for all kinds of applications: Gmail, SalesforceIQ, SMS. </p>

                <h3>What do I need to do to set up the keyboard?
</h3>
                <p>Go to your main iPhone Settings app and click on General. Click on Keyboard. Next, click on Keyboards. Then choose Add New Keyboard. Select KeyReply from the list. You’re done! See this <u><a href="http://keyreply.com/blog/Setting-up-your-KeyReply-custom-keyboard/">article</a></u> for a step-by-step visual guide on how to set the keyboard up.
</p>

                <h3>Is there an easier way to set up the keyboard? Why is it so tough?
</h3>
                <p>The process for adding new keyboards is controlled by Apple. Unfortunately, it’s a little long now due to the way the interactions were set up. Sorry for the inconvenience! We’re all hoping for the process to simplify in the future.
</p>

                <h3>How do I get the KeyReply keyboard to show up in my input methods?
</h3>
                <p>Once you have followed the steps to set up the keyboard, it should automatically show up as one of your input methods. Press and hold on to your languages button on your keyboard (the globe-looking button). You should see a popup of your list of keyboards. Select KeyReply by sliding your finger up to it. The keyboard will now show! Look at this <u><a href="https://keyreply.com/img/KRHome.gif">image</a></u> to see how it’s done visually.
</p>

                <h3>How do I create my first reply?</h3>
                <p>Save your own replies in a category by selecting the category at the bottom of the page on the app. You can create replies within categories too. To delete a reply from the app, swipe left and tap delete. </p>

                <h3>What do the green boxes next to my reply on the app do?</h3>
                <p>You can personalize which replies you see on your keyboard without affecting other team members using the green boxes. By tapping on the box next to the replies, you can choose whether or not you want this reply to appear on your keyboard. Green means it's on your keyboard, grey means it's hidden. </p>

                <h3>How does team syncing work?</h3>
                <p>Adding replies within KeyReply means that others within your team can have access to them too, and everyone can be giving the same high-quality and consistent replies while responding. </p>

                <h3>How do I use the web app?</h3>
                <p>Go to https://app.keyreply.com. You can invite and approve team members, manage user permissions and team settings, add new categories and replies, view audit logs and more, all from the KeyReply application. </p>

                <h3>Can I use the web app to manage replies on my desk/laptop?</h3>
                <p>Of course. You can manage all your replies at app.keyreply.com. It's super useful when you need to create long replies while at your desk, or add the ones you've already saved somewhere else. You have the same access to categories and replies from any web browser, making them easier to manage. Create replies on the web and take them with you on the go! </p>

                <h3>Can I really be more productive with KeyReply?</h3>
                <p>Definitely. By adding your own frequently used replies, you can increase your efficiency by 5-10x by having them on your keyboard too! </p>

                <h4><a href="#top">(Back to top)</a></h4>

<h2><a id="keyboard">Keyboard</a></h2>
                <h3>I can’t seem to return to my categories on the keyboard. Help!
</h3>
                <p>Following the blinking arrow on the top of the keyboard, you can simply swipe your finger in a downward movement and you will return to your category list after clicking through it.
</p>
                <h3>How do I add categories and replies on my KeyReply app?
</h3>
                <p>To add a category, go to the Categories tab on the bottom tab bar. In the Categories tab, click on the button at the top right to add a new category. Name your category and give a description (if you like) and click done. Within the category, you can then start creating new replies by clicking on the red box, or going to your current list of replies and changing the category they are saved in.
</p>

                <h4><a href="#top">(Back to top)</a></h4>


<h2><a id="web">Web app</a></h2>
                <h3>How do I create a new category of responses?</h3>
                <p>On the web app, go to Replies and look for Categories. There is a “+ New Category” button that you can use to add a new category. Click on that and start naming your category and provide a description of the category. Hit save and done!</p>

                <h3>How do I add new replies?</h3>
                <p>Go to Replies on the web app and click on “+ New Reply”. Select which category you want your new reply to be saved in. Write your reply title and text, and hit save. Done!</p>

                <h3>How do I manage my categories and replies?
</h3>
                <p>You can use the edit and delete buttons next to categories and replies to manage them. By clicking on the blue edit button, you can edit titles and descriptions. By clicking on the red delete button, you will delete your items. Be careful as deleting categories will delete all replies within the category.
</p>    

                <h3>How do I add a new team member?
</h3>
                <p>Go to Administration → Users on the web app and click on “Add user” at the top right above the users panel. You can then invite team members to join your team right away. They will receive an email invitation from you, and can sign up for the service either on the site or after they have downloaded the mobile app. They will automatically appear in the panel whenever they are in. 
</p>

                <h3>How do I approve members who request to join my team?
</h3>
                <p>Go to Administration → Users on the web app. You will see a column that says “Approved” next to their names. If it’s currently not approved, it will be greyed out. To approve your team member joining the team, simply click on that button and it will turn green and reflect “yes”.
</p>

                <h3>What are roles? What can I do with roles?
</h3>
                <p>By setting up roles, you can define default permissions for team members on the team. For example, admin rights include the ability to edit everything, while you may want to limit user rights to only reading and using replies. You have a great deal of flexibility to choose how to set these roles up, so that you can simply assign them to team members as they join your team.
</p>

                <h3>How do I manage the permissions of specific members on my team?
</h3>
                <p>You can edit permissions of specific members by going to Administration → Users on the web app and clicking on the blue edit button next to their name. You will see the list of permissions that can be chosen; by checking or unchecking these items, you will be able to set custom permissions for each of your team members as they request them.
</p>
                <h3>Can I track who on my team has logged in or edited things?
</h3>
                <p>Yes, by going to Administration → Audit logs on the web app. You can see all recent instances of who has logged in or edited items in the panel.
</p>

                <h3>Can I export the data in my audit logs?
</h3>
                <p>Definitely. Go to Administration → Audit logs on the web app and find the button on the top right above the panel that says “Export to Excel”. Click it and it should automatically start downloading the data.
</p>

                <h3>How does the 30 day free trial work?
</h3>
                <p>Once you’ve signed up for the service, you will automatically have access to all of KeyReply’s features for 30 days. During this period, you can upgrade anytime by going to Administration → Billing to ensure that there is no disruption of service towards the end of your trial. You won’t be charged until the end of your trial period, so feel free to do that right away :)

</br>Towards the end of the 30 days, we’ll check if you want to upgrade. If you feel ready to buy a paid subscription, you may do so using your credit card or Paypal account. If you choose not to upgrade after the trial period, your access will be discontinued; but if you choose to upgrade again when the time is right for you, your team’s KeyReplies will be ready for you to continue using again.
</p>

                <h3>What do I need to do to start my subscription?
</h3>
                <p>Simply go to Administration → Billing on the web app anytime and click on “Pay now” to bring up the payments panel. Enter your details and we’re ready to roll.
</p>
                <h3>How does the billing cycle work?
</h3>
                <p>We will bill you at the end of every month, and the amount will be pro-rated based on the day of the month you subscribed until the last day of the month. It will be automatically calculated, so no worries about calculating that amount.
</p>

                <h3>How does my team get billed for more team members?
</h3>
                <p>Each team member on your team will be charged the price of the plan, all of which will be consolidated and charged to the main account holder for your team. These fees are automatically calculated, so you don’t have to worry about counting them at checkout.
</p>

                <h3>Is there a pro-rated fee based on the time my team member joins?
</h3>
                <p>Yes, the fees will be automatically pro-rated at the time that billing occurs, based on the day that your team member joins until the day of billing. These fees are automatically calculated and will be reflected in your statement.
</p>

                <h3>Do you have a free plan?
</h3>
                <p>We don’t currently have a free plan, because we truly believe in the value of KeyReply in helping your team. By paying for the service, you are helping us to keep investing in the product to make it better - so you can enjoy the ongoing upgrades that will help you grow your business.
