													<h3>We're on this ship together</h3>
												</header>
												<p>In the summer of 2014, we came together with the aspiration to build a tool that could help people link data points together. It was destined to help with research, like a visual excel. This idea later distilled into something simpler, to solve a specific problem for teams - inefficient communications. Over dozens of interviews, we found that people had issues with repetitive work and contextual responses.</p>
												<header>
													<h3>Navigating towards a world of better communications</h3>
												</header>
												<p>So like good entrepreneurs, we decided to solve this issue for them... And KeyReply was thus born. Besides, personal experience also showed us that there was this issue -  such as Spencer's work at Twitter, Max's own issues with writing, and Carylyne's experience coaching writing.
												<p>We wanted to simplify and expedite the process of communicating. Day and night, we work hard to ensure that we build an awesome product and great content to help teams get started faster and better. </p>
												<header>
													<h3>Buffeted by the winds but straight to course</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Things aren't always smooth-sailing, of course - but we're confident that with the conviction we have, we'll continue to improve the lives of others using the product. Every day, we improve our understanding of how to serve team/enterprise customers, and amplify our impact with them.</p> 
												<p>We see lots more potential in this space - from AI-driven responses, to auto-translated communications and multimedia embeds in messages.</p>
												<header>
													<h3>We're sailing ahead - Are you with us?</h3>
												</header>
												<p>We'll be really excited and honored if you'd like to join our cause: As a customer, an advisor, an investor, as a user feedback tester... Please reach out to us anytime, and we'll love to talk to you. </p>
