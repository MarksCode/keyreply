title: KeyReply is live!
---

Hello world! We conceptualized KeyReply after speaking to enterprise customers, teams, sales and operations folks. We hope that you are as excited about the product as we are. Over 70% of issues can be covered by 10-20 responses. As we start to work more on the go, we believe that empowering teams with a mobile solution to responding is key. KeyReply is an intelligent keyboard to help people respond better and faster. KeyReply is built by the GraphPaper team who has also launched products globally.
