<h3>Before Returning a Product:</h3>
We work hard to ensure that we always get your order right the first time. If you are having issues with a product, there may be other options before you return it:
- If you’re having technical issues, we can help. Please email team@graphpaper.co and we’ll be in touch shortly.
</br></br>

<h3>Return and Exchange Policy:</h3>
GraphPaper’s return policy is summarized here and also discussed in the Terms of Use. The return policy is provided in addition to any statutory return rights that you may have under law. We will accept returns and exchanges for items that meet the return criteria set forth below for 30 days from the date of purchase or download, as applicable. Exceptions are stated below. We may deny any return or exchange if it fails to meet our return criteria.</br>
 
<h3>Return Criteria:</h3>
All products must be returned with reasonable care having been taken (such as must be in a condition that permits us to resell them). All returns and exchanges must be accompanied by all media and product keys. Failure to include such items may prevent or delay your refund or exchange. GraphPaper reserves the right to deny any return if it fails to meet the return criteria and conditions.  GraphPaper will not accept the following items for return: (i) special order items, (ii) items that have been used, altered or that show damage, (iii) performed services, (vi) items marked with a designation such as “Final Sale” or “Non-Returnable.” Please be sure to read the product description carefully before placing your order to ensure that the item will meet your needs.</br></br>

<h3>Additional Conditions:</h3>
Downloadable products and subscriptions. For eligible downloadable products and subscriptions, we may require you to sign an electronic letter of destruction as condition of your return to confirm that you have uninstalled and have not made any copies of the product.  Services. To qualify for return, the service must not have been delivered, performed or consumed by you.  Pre-ordered items. For pre-order items, the 30-day return period begins:

<li>For downloadable products and subscriptions, when the product is delivered electronically to your account and made available for download.</li>
<li>Promotions and bundles. For promotional items and bundles, all included products and/or services must be returned together. If a service included in the promotion and/orbundle has been used (for example a used promotional promo code), or the promotion and/orbundle includes a non-refundable item, the full retail value of the service and/or non-refundableitem will be deducted from the refund amount. When a bundle is purchased and only part ofthe bundle is returned, the bundle discount is void, and the total bundle discount will bededucted from the refund.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
